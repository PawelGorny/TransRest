# TransRest
Transactional REST web services

This projects is an example for web services which support transactions.
The client has a possibility to launch a several CRUD calls which are hold in one database transaction.
Depending on the client's decision, the transaction could be commited or rollbacked.

Please check junit test to see how different use cases are covered. 
Web services are documented in [OpenAPI](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/) document generated by [Swagger plugin](https://swagger.io/) when the project is build.

I use [Atomikos](https://www.atomikos.com/) open-source transaction manager.
